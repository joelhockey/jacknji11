     * <p>
     * Note that implementations need to adhere strictly to PKCS#11 for this strategy 
     * to work robustly. One detail that this implementation relies on is that PKCS#11, 
     * base specification section 5.7.5 C_GetAttributeValue,
     * specifies returning CKR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL and setting uLValueLen to 
     * CK_UNAVAILABLE_INFORMATION, if sent a pre-allocated buffer that is too small to hold the value.
     * There are multuple variations of implementation errors with either the wrong return value
     * or failing to set uLValueLen to the correct value.
     * Due to these common implementation issued, using this strategy requires careful testing 
     * with your HSM, for your use case.
